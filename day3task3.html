<p>
<q>Dr. Satish Kumar</q> was born in <attri href=satish kumar>1971</attri> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh,</a>Andhra Pradesh, South India.
Unfortunately, by the age of 11 <i><mark>He began smoking, gambling and stealing. Vexed with His bad habits his mother would Cry, <del>I shouldn’t have given birth to you…</del>you are a disgrace to our family, she used to say No one can change even God.</mark></i>


Disgusted with his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">Life..</a> <strong>Satish began seeking God who can change His life, miraculously one day He had a divine visitation of Jesus Christ and completely transformed his life. He found new life, a new beginning and purpose for his life on earth</strong>


As He began searching the Holy scriptures He realised, the creation has no meaning without being connected with the Creator. The reason why many people live without Love, Joy, peace is because they are disconnected with their creator WHO is Love and source of Joy and peace. <em>He teaches this simple truth of life; Know God know Peace No God No peace.</em>
